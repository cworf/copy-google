### CSS Week 2 Code Review - Epicodus

# Copy 'Think with Google' site

### Author: Colin Worf

## Description

This site is as close to an exact copy of thinkwithgoogle.com as I could possibly get. I used a combination of CSS Grid and Flex-box to accomplish the main layout, and the rest is simple responsive image handling, lists, and forms. 

This is all custom css, no frameworks. If I could change anything post fact, I would have finished with the svg capture instead of switching over to fontAwesome, hence some of the icons are not exactly perfect.

## Instructions

1. Clone project ```$ git clone https://github.com/cworf/copy-google.git ```
2. enter project by opening the repository and selecting index.html
3. view final project online by visiting https://cworf.github.io/copy-google/
